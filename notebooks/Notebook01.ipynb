    "For now, the challenge in Genomics-Bioinformatics analyses are computational requirement and data storage. Not everyone has access to HPC. With AWS and a bit of money to spend, anyone can have access to a powerful computer. [Pat Schloss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RgRS5VPX1g&list=PLmNrK_nkqBpL0d2E26TqPkmTAfelYKbQX&index=5&t=0s) beautifully summarised the advantages of AWS vs traditional computing in one of his Riffomonas Project Youtube video."
