# AWS_POC tutorial
## A start of an exciting adventure on AWS for Genomics Facility Monash University Malaysia.

Hello everyone. The purpose of this tutorial is to document our experience of using AWS and explore how we can use the plethora of AWS services for genomics research in Monash University Malaysia.

The POC credit was granted because we had a challenge in storage data and computational power for genome hybrid assembly. So while this tutorial touches on hard concepts of AWS, we will also see how we can use AWS services for bioinformatics analysis, assembly of eukaryotic genomes in particular.
