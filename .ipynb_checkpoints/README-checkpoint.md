# AWS_POC tutorial
## A start of an exciting adventure on AWS for Genomics Facility Monash University Malaysia.

Hello everyone. The purpose of this tutorial is to document our experience of using AWS and explore how we can use the plethora of AWS services for genomics research in Monash University Malaysia.

Earlier, we had a challenge in storage data and computational power to conduct a genome hybrid assembly. We approached AWS Singapore and was generously granted with a sum of POC credit. So while this tutorial touches on hard concepts of AWS, we will also see how we can use AWS services for bioinformatics analysis, assembly of eukaryotic genomes in particular.
